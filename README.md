# Next.js Project Setup and Basics

This project is a beginner-friendly setup using **Next.js** and **TypeScript**, focusing on component reuse and props-based rendering. It is part of an ALX training task and includes the implementation of a reusable `Card` component using React functional components and TypeScript interfaces.

## 📌 Project Objective

The purpose of this project is to:
- Understand and practice the use of **React functional components**
- Define and apply **TypeScript interfaces** (`CardProps`)
- Create reusable UI components (Card)
- Organize code using proper folder structure (components/common, interfaces)
- Use dynamic content with props on a sample page (`pages/home.tsx`)
